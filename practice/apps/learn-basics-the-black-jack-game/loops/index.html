    <h3>What is For Loops</h3>
    <p>
        A for loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed
        repeatedly based on a condition. It consists of three main parts:
        initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
    </p>
    <p>Here's the syntax of a for loop:</p>
    <pre><code>for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}</code></pre>
    <p>In this syntax:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Initialization</strong>: This part is executed once at the
            beginning of the loop. It is typically used to initialize a counter
            variable.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Condition</strong>: This part is evaluated before each iteration
            of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. If it
            is false, the loop terminates.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Increment/Decrement</strong>: This part is executed after each
            iteration of the loop. It is typically used to update the counter
            variable.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's an example of a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {console.log(i);}</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, the loop initializes the counter variable
        <code>i</code> to 1, checks if <code>i</code> is less than or equal to 5,
        and increments <code>i</code> by 1 after each iteration. The loop will
        print the numbers 1 to 5 in the console.
    </p>
    <p>
        For loops are commonly used when the number of iterations is known
        beforehand, making them a powerful tool for iterating over arrays,
        performing repetitive tasks, and more.
