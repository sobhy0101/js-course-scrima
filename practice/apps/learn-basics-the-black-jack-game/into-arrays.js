// Arrays - ordered lists of items

// In JavaScript, an array is a special variable that can hold more than one value at a time.
// Arrays are useful for storing lists of data, such as numbers, strings, or even other arrays.

// You create an array using square brackets [] and separate items with commas.

let featuredPosts = [ // Create an array that lists your i.e. recent posts, projects, articles or similar
    "Check out my Netflix clone",
    "Here's the code for my project",
    "I've just relaunched my portfolio"
]

// Each item in the array is called an element.
// Elements can be accessed using their index (position in the array).
// Arrays are zero-indexed: the first item has index 0, the second item has index 1, and so on.

// Example: Accessing the first post
// console.log(featuredPosts[0]); // Output: "Check out my Netflix clone"

// You can store any type of data in an array, including strings, numbers, booleans, or even other arrays.

// Create an array that lists your i.e. experience, education, licenses, skills or similar
// The items of the array should be strings

let myExperience = [
    "CTO at Auto Machina Trading",
    "CTO at Cars Buyer Inc.",
    "Freelance Web and Graphic Deisgner"
]

// Arrays can also hold numbers and boolean values
let sampleArray = [42, true, "hello"];

// You can add, remove, or change elements in an array using various array methods.
// For example:
// featuredPosts.push("New blog post"); // Adds a new item to the end
// featuredPosts.pop(); // Removes the last item

// Arrays are a fundamental part of JavaScript and are used in many programs to manage lists of data.
